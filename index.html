    excerpt: "Our consultants offer the following services:
    
#### Backend Development

We have experience in a broad range of technical stacks, programming languages, and frameworks. From cutting-edge Javascript frameworks to legacy bash scripts, our consultants have seen it all and know how to fix it and build on it.

#### DevOps

Our DevOps consultants ensure your code is clean, well-tested, and easy to iterate on. Our consultants have drawn expertise in software best practices from years of experience at Google, Dropbox, and public research institutions. Their knowledge will translate into a vastly more maintainable codebase, making it many times easier to add features and fix bugs.

#### Site Reliability Engineering

Hybrid cloud environments are no problem for our Site Reliability Engineers. AWS, GCP, or on-prem: we can provide the guidance you need to scale your service to 10K users and beyond!

#### Penetration Testing

Our security engineers are [OSCP](https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/) and [OSWE](https://www.offensive-security.com/awae-oswe/)-certified. Our web and infrastructure security assessments and penetration testing find vulnerabilities before hackers do and provide remediation guidance."
